# Advent of code

These are my solutions to the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) events that happen every year.

Inside each year, the `data` folder contains two sets of input data:

-   The `given` data, or the data used when explaining the question.
-   The `raw` data, which is the data used when providing a solution to the puzzle.

Inside each day, marked with the day, the `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` files are the ones that need to be run for the two halves of each puzzle.

## During Advent of code

This repo is public, so I'll try my best to avoid posting my solutions until 12-24 hours after the puzzle comes out, that way you can't secure too many points using my code.
